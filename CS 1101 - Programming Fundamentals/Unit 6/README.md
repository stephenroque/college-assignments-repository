**(a).**

The code starts by defining a list of 10 employee names. It then splits
this list into two equal sub-lists, subList1 and subList2, each
containing 5 names. The code then adds a new employee, "Kriti Brown", to
subList2 and removes the second employee from subList1. The two
sub-lists are then merged back together to form a new list, mergedList.
The code also defines a list of salaries, salaryList, and updates this
list by increasing each salary by 4%. The updated salaryList is then
sorted in descending order, and the top 3 salaries are stored in
top3Salaries. The mergedList, salaryList, and top3Salaries are then
printed out.

**(b).**

The code begins with a predefined sentence. It then uses the split()
function to break this sentence into a list of words, wordList. The
split() function works by dividing the input string at each instance of
a whitespace character, such as a space, thereby creating a list where
each word from the sentence is an element. The code then reverses this
list of words to create reversedWordList. This is done using list
slicing with a step of -1, which starts from the end of the list and
ends at position 0, effectively reversing the order of elements.
Finally, the wordList and reversedWordList are printed out.
