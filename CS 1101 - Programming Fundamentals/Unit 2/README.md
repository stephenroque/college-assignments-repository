**Part 1**

**Explanation:**

-   The function *print\_circum* encapsulates the logic for calculating
    the circumference of a circle, promoting code reusability.

-   The local variable *pi* is used to store the value of Ï€, enhancing
    code readability and allowing for easy modification if a more
    precise value is needed.

-   The formula *circumference = 2 \* pi \* radius* calculates the
    circumference based on the input radius.

-   The *print* statement outputs the result in a user-friendly format,
    including the calculated circumference.

**Part 2**

**Explanation:**

The code defines a function named *print\_catalog* that takes three
parameters (*item1*, *item2*, and *item3*). The function calculates the
prices for different combinations of items using specified discount
percentages for combo packs. It then constructs a catalog string,
including the prices of individual items and the calculated combo
prices, and finally prints the catalog.

-   The function calculates the prices for various combinations
    (*combo1*, *combo2*, *combo3*, *combo4*) based on the given discount
    percentages (*combo\_pack* and *gift\_pack*).

-   The *catalog* string is constructed by concatenating various lines
    containing product names and their prices.

-   The *print\_catalog* function is called with the prices of three
    items (*price\_item1*, *price\_item2*, *price\_item3*) as arguments.

**Features Illustrated:**

-  **Functions:** The code demonstrates the use of a function
    (*print\_catalog*) to encapsulate a series of statements related to
    generating a catalog. This promotes code reusability and
    organization.

-  **Variables and Expressions:** The variables *combo1*, *combo2*,
    *combo3*, and *combo4* store the calculated prices based on
    expressions involving the given item prices and discount
    percentages.

-  **String Concatenation:** The *catalog* string is created by
    concatenating multiple strings to build the final catalog output.

-  **Function Invocation:** The *print\_catalog* function is invoked
    with specific arguments (*price\_item1*, *price\_item2*,
    *price\_item3*) to generate and print the catalog.

The output represents a formatted catalog of an online store, including
individual item prices and prices for various combo packs.
