# Library Management System

This Java-based program is a simple Library Management System that allows users to add, borrow, and return books. It utilizes a `HashMap` to store books by their titles and keeps track of book quantities, borrowed books, and their availability.

## Features

- **Add Books**: Users can add new books to the library or update the quantity of existing books.
- **Borrow Books**: Users can borrow a specified quantity of a book, provided there are enough copies available.
- **Return Books**: Users can return borrowed books, and the system will update the borrowed quantity accordingly.
- **Input Validation**: The program ensures that users input valid data for book quantities and menu options.

## How It Works

1. **Book Class**: Represents individual books, including the title, author, total quantity, and the number of borrowed copies.
2. **LibrarySystem Class**: Manages the library by adding, borrowing, and returning books, and maintains the list of books in a `HashMap` using their titles as keys.
3. **Main Menu**: The program offers a simple text-based menu where users can:
    - Add a book
    - Borrow a book
    - Return a book
    - Exit the system
4. **Exception Handling**: The program handles invalid user inputs, such as non-integer values for quantities and menu options.

## Example Output

```plaintext

1. Add Book
2. Borrow Book
3. Return Book

2. Borrow Book
3. Return Book
4. Exit

```

## Menu Options

1. **Add Book**: Adds a new book to the library or updates the quantity of an existing book.
2. **Borrow Book**: Allows a user to borrow a specified quantity of a book, if available.
3. **Return Book**: Allows a user to return a borrowed quantity of a book.
4. **Exit**: Exits the program.
