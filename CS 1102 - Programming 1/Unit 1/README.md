**Explanation:**

I\'ve created a Java program that simulates a Formula 1 quiz game. Let
me walk you through how it works.

First, I set up some initial variables like the score and the total
number of questions. Then, I use a Scanner object to handle user input.
Next, I define the questions, options, and correct answers using arrays.
Each question has four options labeled A, B, C, and D.

Then comes the main part: looping through each question. For each
question, I display the question and its options. Then, I prompt the
user to enter their answer by typing A, B, C, or D. I\'ve included input
validation to ensure the user\'s input is a single character and one of
the valid options.

Once the user provides an answer, I compare it to the correct answer and
update the score accordingly. If the answer is correct, I increase the
score and display a \"Correct!\" message; otherwise, I display the
correct answer.

After all questions are answered, I calculate the final score as a
percentage and display it to the user. Finally, I close the Scanner
object to release system resources and thank the user for playing the
quiz.

**Compiling and Running the Code:**

1.  Save the code as "F1Quiz.java".

2.  Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory where you saved
    the file.

3.  Compile the code using "javac F1Quiz.java".

4.  Run the program using "java F1Quiz".
