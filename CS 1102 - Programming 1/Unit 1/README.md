# Formula 1 Quiz

This Java program is a simple console-based quiz game where users answer five Formula 1 related questions. Each question is multiple-choice, and the user can input answers from the options provided. The program calculates the user's score based on correct answers and provides feedback after each question.

## Features

- **5 Multiple Choice Questions**: The quiz contains questions related to Formula 1 history, teams, drivers, and terminology.
- **Input Validation**: Users can only enter valid answers (A, B, C, D).
- **Score Calculation**: After all questions, the program calculates and displays the final score and percentage.

## Questions

1. Which team has won the most Formula 1 constructors' championships?
2. Which driver has won the most Grand Prix races?
3. What is the name of the first ever Formula 1 race track?
4. Which team won the Constructors' Championship in 2023?
5. What does DRS stand for in Formula 1?

## How It Works

1. **Question Display**: The program displays each question with four options (A, B, C, D).
2. **User Input**: The program waits for the user to enter one of the options (A, B, C, or D). It ensures that the user enters a valid choice before proceeding.
3. **Answer Validation**: After the user inputs an answer, the program checks if the answer is correct and updates the score accordingly.
4. **Final Score**: At the end of the quiz, the program displays the total score out of 5 and the percentage of correct answers.
