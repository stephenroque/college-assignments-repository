# Student Record Management System

This Java-based Student Record Management System allows users to add new students, update student information, and view student details. It uses a simple console-based menu system to manage and interact with the student records.

## Features

- **Add New Student**: Add a new student to the system with validation checks for unique student IDs, valid age input, and non-empty fields.
- **Update Student Information**: Update details like name, age, or grade for existing students by their ID.
- **View Student Details**: View the complete details of a student using their unique student ID.
- **Data Validation**: Ensures proper input for student name, age, and grade, including checks for unique IDs and numeric age values.

## Program Overview

1. **Student Class Representation**: 
   - Student details (name, ID, age, and grade) are stored in a 2D array, where each student occupies a row.
   - Each student‚Äôs record consists of four fields: Name, ID, Age, and Grade.
   
2. **Main Menu**:
   - The system presents a menu with options:
     1. Add a new student.
     2. Update student information.
     3. View student details.
     4. Exit the program.

3. **User Input**:
   - The program uses the `Scanner` class to read input from the user, ensuring proper validation at each step.
   
4. **System Limitations**:
   - The system assumes a maximum of 100 students (due to the fixed array size).
   - It uses a 2D array (`students[][]`) to store the data, which can be extended to a more complex data structure like a database if needed.
