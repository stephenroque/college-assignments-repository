# **Vehicle Information System**

## **Overview**

The **Vehicle Information System** is a Java-based application that allows users to manage different types of vehicles such as **Cars**, **Motorcycles**, and **Trucks**. It offers an interactive command-line interface for users to add, display, and manage vehicle information including make, model, year, and other specific attributes for each vehicle type.

### **Features:**
- Add vehicles such as cars, motorcycles, and trucks to the system.
- Display all registered vehicles with detailed information.
- Store and manage vehicle-specific details like the number of doors (for cars), number of wheels (for motorcycles), cargo capacity (for trucks), and more.
- The system supports an extensible design with interfaces for common vehicle attributes and specific vehicle types.

## **Project Structure**

The project consists of the following main classes and interfaces:

1. **`Vehicle.java`**: The common interface for all vehicles, defining essential methods.
2. **`Car.java`**: Represents a car, implementing the `Vehicle` and `CarVehicle` interfaces.
3. **`Motorcycle.java`**: Represents a motorcycle, implementing the `Vehicle` and `MotorVehicle` interfaces.
4. **`Truck.java`**: Represents a truck, implementing the `Vehicle` and `TruckVehicle` interfaces.
5. **`CarVehicle.java`**: Interface defining additional methods for cars.
6. **`MotorVehicle.java`**: Interface defining additional methods for motorcycles.
7. **`TruckVehicle.java`**: Interface defining additional methods for trucks.
8. **`MainProgram.java`**: The main program class with a command-line interface for interacting with the system.

## **How to Run**

### Prerequisites
- JDK 8 or higher.

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/stephenroque/college-assignments-repository.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd college-assignments-repository/CS\ 1102\ -\ Programming\ 1/Unit\ 6/Vehicle\ Information\ System\ for\ a\ Car\ Rental\ Agency/src/
   ```

### **Setup**
1. Compile the Java files:
