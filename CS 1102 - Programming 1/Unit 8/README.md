**Program Summary**

**Purpose**

The purpose of the program is to demonstrate how to use the "Function"
interface and streams in Java to manipulate and process data from a list
of employees. The operations include transforming employee objects into
specific strings, calculating the average salary, and filtering
employees based on an age criterion.

**Characteristics of the Function Interface**

1. **Definition**: The \`Function\` interface is part of the
    "java.util.function" package and represents a function that takes an
    argument of type "T" and returns a result of type "R".

2. **Apply Method**: The primary method of the interface is "apply",
    which applies the function to a given argument.

3. **Functionality**: The interface is a functional interface, meaning
    it can be used as the assignment target for a lambda expression or
    method reference.

**Usage of the Function Interface in the Program**

1. **Defining a Lambda Function:**

    -   In the program, the "Function" interface is used to define a
        lambda function that takes an "Employee" object and returns a
        concatenated string with the employee\'s name and department.

2. **Applying the Function with Streams:**

    -   The function is then applied to each element of the employee
        list using the "map" method of streams. This transforms each
        "Employee" into a string with the concatenated name and
        department.

**Representing a Function**

The "Function" interface in Java represents a mathematical function
that:

-  **Takes an Input**: Receives an argument of a specific type
    ("Employee" in this example).

-  **Produces an Output**: Returns a result of a specific type
    ("String" in this example).

This ability to encapsulate behavior that transforms data allows for
more modular and reusable programming, making it easier to manipulate
and transform data collections using streams.

**Conclusion**

The "Function" interface and streams in Java provide a powerful and
concise way to manipulate data collections. By encapsulating operations
in reusable functions and applying these functions using streams, the
code becomes more readable, modular, and efficient. In this program, we
demonstrated these techniques by transforming employee data and
performing calculations and filters in an efficient and expressive
manner.
